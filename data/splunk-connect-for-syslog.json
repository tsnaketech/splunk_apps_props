        "description": "Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source packaged solution to get data into Splunk using syslog-ng (OSE) and the Splunk HTTP event Collector.\nPurpose\nSplunk Connect for Syslog (SC4S) is a community project that helps reduce the pain of getting syslog data sources into Splunk. Splunk Connect for Syslog should be used by any Splunk customer needing to onboard data sources via syslog to Splunk. The primary pain points SC4S addresses include the following:\nLack of deep syslog expertise in the community\nInconsistency between syslog server deployments, which creates a support challenge\nData sources tagged with catch-all sourcetype \u201csyslog\u201d, which limits Splunk analytics\nUneven data distribution between Splunk indexers, which impacts search performance\nVersions:\nSC4S Enterprise is designed for Business that:   \nOperate large-scale infrastructures where system stability is critical\nRequire long-term support with minimal disruption\nPrefer fewer updates without compromising on quality\nSC4S lite is designed for Business that:   \nThe log types are limited and volume of data is too high\nRequire local parsers for unsupported vendors \nPrefer custom data sources\nSC4S regular is designed for Business that:  \nAll kind of business big, small and large and who likes the pace\nRegular updates and fixes\nFrequent New features and experimental enhancements\nBenefits:\n* Repeatable, Concise, and Prescriptive Splunk solution for syslog\n* Removal of the UF reduces configuration and management effort\n* Turnkey deployment via the SC4S container architecture\n* A library of data source filters we will be continually growing with the help of the community\n* Exceptionally even event distribution across the Splunk Indexers (benefits search performance)\n* Enhanced data enrichment beyond the standard Splunk metadata of timestamp, host, source, and sourcetype\n* Easily add custom \u201cfilters\u201d for additional sourcetypes beyond those supported out of the box\n* Complete deployment documentation\n\nEdge Processor Integration:\nSC4S can be seamlessly integrated to Edge processor for further filtering of data, advance processing and sending to other custom destinations. https://splunk.github.io/splunk-connect-for-syslog/main/edge_processor/\n\nSplunk Support: If you are an existing Splunk customer with access to the Support Portal, create a support ticket for the quickest resolution to any issues you experience. Here are some examples of when it may be appropriate to create a support ticket:\n1. If you experience an issue with the current version of SC4S, such as a feature gap or a documented feature that is not working as expected.\n2. If you have difficulty with the configuration of SC4S, either at the back end or with the out-of-box parsers or index configurations.\n3. If you experience performance issues and need help understanding the bottlenecks.\n4. If you have any questions or issues with the SC4S documentation.\nFor everything else raise github issue",
